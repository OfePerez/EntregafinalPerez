                    <p>Hi! I’m Ofe— a Full-Stack Developer who loves turning ideas into meaningful digital experiences. I’m passionate about crafting intuitive, functional, and visually appealing web applications that connect technology with creativity.</p>
                    <p>My journey into development grew from a genuine curiosity about how things work and a deep appreciation for design and logic. I enjoy working across both front-end and back-end, where I can blend structure with imagination to build complete, seamless solutions.</p>
                    <p>Outside the screen, I find inspiration in art and music — especially classical composers like Vivaldi — which help me stay grounded and inspired. I also love inline skating; it gives me the same sense of rhythm and flow I seek in my code: balance, movement, and precision.For me, development isn’t just about code — it’s about creating harmony between creativity and technology.</p>

                    <span>Projects i've worked on</span>
                    <p>Throughout my journey as a Full-Stack Developer, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects — from open-source collaborations to enterprise solutions and personal experiments that blend creativity and technology.</p>
                    <p>In the open-source community, I’ve contributed to front-end libraries and UI frameworks focused on accessibility and responsive design, helping improve documentation, optimize components, and refine user interfaces.</p>     <p>I’ve also participated in collaborative GitHub projects centered on API integration and performance optimization.Within company projects, I’ve been involved in developing full-stack web applications using technologies like React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL — building scalable back-end systems, secure authentication flows, and clean, user-friendly dashboards for business analytics and data visualization.</p>
                    <p>On a more personal level, I love creating side projects that let me explore the artistic side of development — such as interactive portfolios, creative landing pages, and minimalist web apps where I experiment with animation, design systems, and UX storytelling.Each project, whether professional or personal, has deepened my understanding of how design, logic, and emotion can coexist beautifully in code.</p>
